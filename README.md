# Current Features

- The 'Rock Paper Scissors' header sits at the top of the page and shows the name of the game in a minimalistic font.

- The game interface displays three different icons to choose from which are rock, paper and scissors.

- When the user touches an icon, it turns a darkk purple, indicating that it can be clicked on.
