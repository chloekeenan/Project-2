# Current Features
**Header**
- The 'Rock Paper Scissors' header sits at the top of the page and shows the name of the game in a minimalistic font.
 
**Game Interface**
- The game interface displays three different icons to choose from which are rock, paper and scissors.

- When the user touches an icon, it turns a darkk purple, indicating that it can be clicked on. 

- When clicked, the game result will be shown immediately. It will be either a Win, Lose or Draw.

**Game Results**
- The scores are recorded in the two score boxes, which are clearly designated in an outline color that corresponds to the game field's icon colors.


# Future Features

- I'd like to add a multiplayer mode to the game, so the user can play against either a human or a machine.
